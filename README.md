## How do I approach designing software?
Design software around user needs. Try to avoid getting bogged down with "it would be nice if..." features that aren't core to the product. Plan, design, develop, test, and repeat until deployment.

## How do I approach developing programs?
Usually using the principles of OOP. Strive for abstraction. Write code that is modular and re-usable when possible.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science is just an academic study of a constantly changing field. Higher education institutions are not incentivized to update their curriculum frequently because 1. people don't get to see the course before they buy it, 2. people will enroll anyways because 3. corporations simultaneously demand university degrees while scrutinizing our ability to do anything at all.
